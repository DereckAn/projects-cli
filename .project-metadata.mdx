# projects-cli

## Description

This is a simple project to create files, folders, and workflows for each repository. This makes it faster and almost automates the display of each repository in my portfolio. 

## Key Features

- CLI tool
- Key Generator
- Github Actions

## Challenges

During development, I faced several technical challenges:

- **Interactive Input with Bun**: The initial implementation using `Bun.stdin.read()` didn't work properly for interactive prompts. Had to research and switch to `@inquirer/prompts` library for reliable user input handling.

- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Dealing with optional parameters and ensuring type safety across the codebase, especially with the `prompt` function return types and array access patterns.

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Designing a workflow that could parse MDX files, extract metadata, and send it to an external API required understanding GitHub Actions syntax and environment variables.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the CLI works seamlessly with both `npx` (Node.js) and `bunx` (Bun) while maintaining the shebang configuration.

## Outcomes

This project taught me valuable lessons:

- **CLI Development**: Learned how to build professional command-line tools with proper argument parsing, colored output, and interactive prompts.

- **Automation with GitHub Actions**: Gained hands-on experience creating CI/CD workflows that automate portfolio updates, including metadata extraction and API integration.

- **Package Publishing**: Understood the complete process of publishing npm packages, including configuring `package.json`, creating proper documentation, and managing versions.

- **Developer Experience**: Focused on creating a smooth DX with clear prompts, helpful error messages, and comprehensive documentation.

- **MDX and Frontmatter**: Learned to work with MDX format and gray-matter library for parsing structured content.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add validation for URLs and image paths before generating files
- [ ] Support for multiple languages/i18n in generated content
- [ ] Interactive mode to update existing metadata without recreating files
- [ ] Template system for customizable README and MDX formats
- [ ] Integration with image optimization services (TinyPNG, Cloudinary)
- [ ] Support for multiple portfolio endpoints (sync to multiple sites)
- [ ] Add `--dry-run` flag to preview changes before creating files
- [ ] Generate placeholder images automatically
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for portfolio project views
- [ ] Create a web UI for managing project metadata
